# reviz

Reviz is a set of d3 visualizations, ready to be used as react components.

## Features

We want to keep reviz as simple as possible so you might realize that the components are really simple and they mostly and all the configuration is called on the component mount. For each component there are different parameters (we are working on the documentation as we go).

Currently we have the following d3 visualizations:
* Force Directed
* DAG
